# full-stack-app

This full stack application allows users to administer a school database containing information about courses. I built the Front End and UI using Create React App and constructed the REST API using Express/Node. Authenticated Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. 

To view the project:

First, in the api folder: 

To install dependencies for the REST API use the package manager [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/:

```
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```
npm start

Next In the client folder:
